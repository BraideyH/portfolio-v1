# Braidey Hooper Portfolio

## Description

With this assignment, I was tasked with creating an application to store previous webpages in order to make a professional portfolio. The navigation bar comes with links that take the view down to the corrosponing sections given the same name. This allows the viewer to see information about me, my work, and various link provided to contact me. This application is a work in progress through it did further my knowledge when it comes CSS and implementing images. 

## Installation

To open my porfolio, you must click on the URL. Once opened, you have the option to click on any three of the naviagtion bar headings that will then automatically take you to the associated sections within the webpage. This includes the 'About Me' section that provides two photos of myself and a little description of what my life looks like now. Then, at the bottom of the page, the viewer has the choice to email me, call me, or view my Github account; all of which provide easy shortcuts to each action.
